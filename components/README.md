# ESPHome Components

This folder is required by ESPHome when this repository is used as an external component source.

For the actual component implementations, see the `esphome/components` directory which contains:
- `respeaker_xvf3800` - Main ReSpeaker XVF3800 component
- `aic3104` - Audio codec component
- `sendspin` - Media synchronization component with media_source and media_player platforms

This placeholder ensures the `components` folder exists for ESPHome compatibility.
